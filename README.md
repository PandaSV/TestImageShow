This is a test assignment.

The app consists of a single activity and uses Jetpack Compose for the UI.

Some notes I would like to add before you check it:
I had limited time (and in the middle I had to take my daughter to her basketball class) because I had to leave for the family business.

The required functionality is present in a lean form.
No fancy indications (downloading, showing duration etc.), which can be added in some extra time.
Some components I used are formally deprecated, but see it as cut corners — the principal functionality is implemented. Looking for a new solution would again take me a little extra time.
Forgot about the crossfade — could add an animated alpha value, then find a smarter solution.
Some things aren't perfectly organized, like constants etc.
Had to give up on tests and previews.

To conclude, the app is a little feral and unpolished, but it ticks the main boxes. Hope you can derive the needed info from it.
